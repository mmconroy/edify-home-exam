## Edify - React Developer Take Home Test

### Assignment

Build a single page application using React

### Requirements

The application should utilize a public API and build:
● List view
● Detail view
● On-page or API level filtering for the list view

Implement a toggleable fake-delay mechanism that would simulate a network delay/ slowdown
on the site.
● The toggle function can be anything from a UI component to URL params.
● Preferably, the delay can be configurable, but if not, a 1sec to 2secs delay is reasonable.

### Deliverables

Github repo containing:
● All source code
● Readme with instructions to run the application
● Optional: video demonstrating application in use

### Bonus

● Unit testing via jest or mocha/chai with mocked requests for the API
● End-to-end testing via cypress
● Store favorites in local storage
○ Tab/page/slideout panel to view favorites
● Typescript

### Instagram Example

● List view of popular posts
● Filter posts by hashtag
● Open a modal with a specific post
